/**
 * Following ITCSS idea [https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/]:
 * Settings - vars, configs, switches, brand colours
 * Tools - mixins, functions
 * Generic - normalisers/rules setters
 * Base - Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors) last layer we see these
 * Objects - Cosmetic free design patterns
 * Components - Designed components - chunks of UI - these will usually accompany a react component
 * Trumps - helpers and overrides ususally have !important
 *
 * All rules only ever ADD and INHERIT from previous layers
 * Order stylesheets from generic to localised (as above)
 * write css in specificity order.

 * 3 types of styling:
 * - Theming - appears listed below, these are set once per project
 * - Context - is passed into a component from parents/context and does not appear listed here
 * - Definition - accompany actual react components and only set the things that define that component. Typically set once per lifetime of component
